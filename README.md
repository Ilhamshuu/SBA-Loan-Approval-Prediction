# Loan Risk Assessment for SBA

## Background

The Small Business Administration (SBA) plays a pivotal role in supporting small businesses by providing financial assistance in the form of loans. Ensuring the success of these loans and minimizing the risk of defaults is essential for the financial health of the SBA.

In this project, we aim to assess the risk associated with loans granted by the SBA by analyzing historical loan data. By understanding the factors that contribute to successful loan repayments and identifying areas of concern, we can make informed decisions to improve the loan application process, reduce default rates, and enhance the support offered to small businesses.

Florida (46%), Georgia (43%), and Nevada (42%) have the highest default rates, while North Dakota (15%), Wyoming (14%), and Vermont (14%) exhibit the lowest.

## Business Recommendations

- **Targeted Promotion**: Focus promotional efforts on companies in the management company, Min/Quar/Oil_Gas_ext, and Ag/For/Fish/Hunt sectors due to their high average loan amounts, limited borrower base, and low default rates. Offer exclusive paths and interest rate reductions for borrowers in these sectors.

- **Risk Management Enhancement**: For high default rate industries such as Real Estate/Rental/Lease, Finance/Insurance, Transportation/Warehousing, implement stringent risk management and credit assessment practices. This includes improved verification processes, better decision-making strategies, and active customer monitoring.

- **Marketing Strategy Evaluation**: In regions with high default rates, such as Florida, Georgia, and Nevada, reassess marketing strategies and risk assessment practices. Consider enhancing credit assessments or reducing risk exposure in these areas.
